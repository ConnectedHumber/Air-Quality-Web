# Welcome!

> The Web Interface for the _Monitair_ project.

This is the documentation for [Air Quality Web](https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Air-Quality-Web/), the air quality web interface that displays data from sensors scattered about the globe.

Despite being called _Air Quality Web_, this project is in fact a generic interface to display sensor data and any data displayed should not be considered the definitive air quality data (consult your local council for this information).

Check out the sections in the sidebar for documentation on the installation process, configuring an installation, and the HTTP API provided.
